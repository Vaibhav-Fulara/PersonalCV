                <p>Hi! I am Vaibhav Fulara. As a Software Development Engineer at Oracle, I contribute to the development of scalable, data-driven solutions that empower stakeholders with actionable insights. I designed and managed Oracle’s Sales and Service Dashboard, enabling data-driven decision-making for key business functions. Additionally, I developed a bulk Service Request Dashboard, which optimizes the processing of multiple requests by leveraging asynchronous processing and multithreading, significantly reducing processing times. My work involves a wide range of technologies, including JavaScript, Java, API Development, Algorithmic Design and Analysis, Microservices, Logstash, Kibana, ElasticSearch, KnockoutJS (similar to ReactJS), and Oracle Visual Builder Studio. Prior to joining Oracle, I worked at The DataFlow Group, where I focused on back-end development for data-intensive applications using TypeScript, ExpressJS, and algorithms. I collaborated closely with front-end teams, QA teams, and product managers to deliver robust, user-friendly solutions for Primary Source Verification systems. I also have a strong background in Deep Learning and Generative AI, gained during my tenure at Intello Labs, a leading AI company in the agriculture sector. There, I contributed to the development and deployment of deep learning models for image analysis, quality assessment, and crop yield prediction. I hold a Bachelor of Technology degree from Delhi Technological University, where I honed my engineering, programming, and problem-solving skills.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>At The DataFlow Group, I played a key role in building and maintaining the company’s back-end systems, starting with the development of its foundational microservice architecture, which became the backbone for various backend services. I designed and implemented critical components, such as logging and exception libraries, to enhance error tracking and system monitoring using AWS CloudWatch. I also built the company’s main customer-facing product, the Verification Platform, from the ground up, developing Client Onboarding Services, Applicant Onboarding Services, and Document Management Systems using AWS S3 Buckets to ensure efficient data handling.</li>
                <li>Additionally, I developed an advanced Email Monitoring Service that retrieved email responses in real-time using IMAP, stored attachments in AWS Buckets, and distributed responses to other services through AWS SNS Topics and SQS Queues with a scalable Pub-Sub mechanism. To optimize data retrieval, I engineered robust pagination logic across all backend services, significantly improving performance and user experience. I also contributed to Low-Level System Design (LLD) discussions, demonstrating my problem-solving skills and technical expertise. My work utilized technologies such as TypeScript, ExpressJS, DynamoDB, AWS, System Design, and Algorithmic Design and Analysis to deliver efficient and scalable solutions.</li>

                <li>At Intello Labs, I worked on Generative AI models to produce and refine fruit contour images, significantly improving the training efficiency of the company’s Machine Learning algorithms. By fine-tuning pre-trained Stable Diffusion models for this task, I reduced data collection and refining costs by nearly 65%. I also utilized Meta AI's Segment Anything Model (SAM) to automate contour tagging in images, minimizing manual effort and reducing errors in data tagging.</li>
                <li>I contributed to the cardamom classification process, achieving an overall sorting accuracy of 96.3%. My role involved data collection, tagging, refining, segregation, and deploying the trained model on the company’s cloud platform. This work showcased my expertise in Python, Machine Learning, Algorithmic Design and Analysis, OpenCV, and TensorFlow.</li>
